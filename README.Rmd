This is a web app for close-kin capture-recapture study power analysis by simulation. It simulates datasets from capture-recapture studies of populations of animals over time, checks whether the simulations match certain expectations, fits close-kin and/or conventional capture-recapture models to the datasets, and analyses the resulting estimates.
