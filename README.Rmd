```

This is a little web app in Shiny to illustrate close-kin capture-recapture parameter estimation via simulation. It simulates datasets from capture-recapture studies of a population of animals over time.  It takes the simulated population growth rate as input, and shows the population sizes over time, the negative log-likelihood for the first sample, and the expected versus observed numbers of kin-pairs and the MLEs over all samples.
    
### Things to do

- Allow survey years to be selected
- Update readme and app description to include new inputs and popan model
- Incorporate the number of animals for which we don't know the parents into the calculations of the expected numbers of kin pairs.  And model-fitting?  Warnings when too high?
- Find confidence interval coverage.
- Try plotting relationships between samples?
