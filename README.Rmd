This is a little web app in Shiny to illustrate close-kin capture-recapture parameter estimation via simulation. It simulates datasets from capture-recapture studies of a population of animals over time.  It takes the simulated population growth rate as input, and shows the negative log-likelihood for the first sample, and the MLEs over all samples.
