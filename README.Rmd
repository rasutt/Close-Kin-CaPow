This is a web app for close-kin capture-recapture study power analysis by simulation. It simulates datasets from capture-recapture studies of populations of animals over time, checks that the simulations match certain expectations, fits close-kin and/or conventional capture-recapture models to the datasets, and analyses the resulting estimates. It assumes that self, parent-offspring, and half-sibling pairs can be identified.
