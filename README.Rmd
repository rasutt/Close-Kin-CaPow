This is a little web app in Shiny to illustrate close-kin capture-recapture parameter estimation via simulation. It simulates datasets from capture-recapture studies of a population of animals over time.  It takes the simulated population growth rate as input, and shows the population size over time and the negative log-likelihood for the first sample, and the MLEs over all samples.

### Things to do

- Include outputs for the sim validation functions in the Check.R script.
- Incorporate the number of animals for which we don't know the parents into the calculations of the expected numbers of kin pairs.
- Change proportions calculations to use numbers captured, not total numbers alive.
