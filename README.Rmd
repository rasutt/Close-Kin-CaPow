This is a web app to perform close-kin capture-recapture study power analysis via simulation. It simulates multiple populations of animals over time, and datasets from capture-recapture studies of those populations, checks that the simulations have the expected characteristics, fits close-kin and/or conventional capture-recapture models to the datasets, and analyses the resulting estimates.
